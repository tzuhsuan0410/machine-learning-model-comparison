# Classification Results Summary (Stroke Prediction)

Models compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression with Lasso
- CART
- KNN
- Random Forest
- SVM

Evaluation metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, AUC

Key observations:
- Tree-based models (CART, Random Forest) achieved higher overall accuracy.
- Logistic Regression and SVM showed better sensitivity for stroke prediction,
  which is important due to class imbalance.
- Random Forest provided a good balance between sensitivity and AUC.

Detailed hyperparameter tuning results and full tables
are provided in `codebook/classification_data_description_and_analysis.pdf`.
